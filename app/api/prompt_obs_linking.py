Types of Observations and Linking Requirements: A Simplified Guide for New Learners
This document is structured to introduce new learners to the various types of observations used in early childhood education, highlighting when minimal or full linking is required. This framework will help learners understand how and when to link observations to important educational standards, principles, practices, theories, and childcare philosophy.
________________________________________
1. Anecdotal Records
Description:
Anecdotal records are brief, narrative-style observations that capture significant moments or behaviours during a child’s daily activities.
Purpose:
To document spontaneous, meaningful events, providing insight into a child’s development.
Linking Requirements (Minimal):
•	EYLF Outcome: Typically linked to one outcome that aligns with the observed behaviour.
•	Interpretation: Brief interpretation of the observation.
When Minimal Linking Is Enough:
•	Use this observation type when capturing isolated moments of behaviour, where a simple connection to one EYLF outcome suffices. Avoid over-complicating by linking to multiple principles or theorists.
________________________________________
2. Jottings
Description:
Jottings are short, quick notes taken during or after observing a child. They provide snapshots of behaviour, skills, or interactions.
Purpose:
To track specific actions or behaviours without requiring detailed narrative.
Linking Requirements (Minimal):
•	EYLF Outcome: Link to a single outcome that matches the observed behaviour.
•	Interpretation: A simple reflection of what the behaviour means in terms of development.
When Minimal Linking Is Enough:
•	Use jottings when documenting short, momentary actions. Minimal reflection and linking are necessary—only connect to key EYLF outcomes and briefly interpret the behaviour.

3. Time Samples
Description:
Time samples are a method of recording observations at regular intervals, focusing on how a child engages in various activities.
Purpose:
To assess the child’s attention span, preferences, and engagement over a period.
Linking Requirements (Moderate):
•	EYLF Outcome: Primarily focus on outcome related to engagement and learning through activities.
•	Interpretation: Provide a reflection based on observed patterns and engagement levels.
•	Practices: Link to learning environments and play-based learning principles.
When Moderate Linking Is Sufficient:
•	Time samples typically track specific behaviours over time, and moderate linking to EYLF outcomes is needed. There’s no requirement for detailed connections to theorists or multiple standards.

4. Checklists
Description:
Checklists involve tracking specific skills or developmental milestones that children are expected to meet.
Purpose:
To monitor developmental progress in a systematic, straightforward way.
Linking Requirements (Minimal):
•	EYLF Outcome: Link to one outcome that is being tracked.
•	Interpretation: Simple confirmation of whether or not a milestone has been met.
When Minimal Linking Is Enough:
•	Checklists are practical tools for quickly checking development against specific criteria. Minimal linking is sufficient as the primary focus is to mark progress in key areas.

5. Learning Stories
Description:
Learning stories provide a reflective narrative of a child’s learning journey over time. They are more detailed and explore how children develop through activities and interactions.
Purpose:
To reflect on a child’s strengths, learning, and interests over time, connecting it to their growth.
Linking Requirements (High):
•	EYLF Outcomes: Link to multiple outcomes that reflect both social and physical development.
•	Principles: Include links to holistic approaches and intentional teaching.
•	Practices: Should align with responsive teaching and learning through play.
•	Theorists: Tie in relevant theorists like Erikson or Vygotsky if applicable.
•	Service Philosophy: Reflect on how the observation aligns with the service’s core educational goals.
•	NQF Standards: Highlight any applicable standards related to child development and learning environments.
When Full Linking Is Necessary:
•	Learning stories require comprehensive connections to multiple areas. As they document long-term progress, it’s essential to link all aspects of the child's development to EYLF outcomes, philosophies, and practices.

6. Event Samples
Description:
Event samples focus on tracking specific behaviours or developmental concerns during a defined event or activity.
Purpose:
To address particular developmental milestones or concerns by observing specific behaviours.
Linking Requirements (High):
•	EYLF Outcomes: Link to multiple outcomes that reflect cognitive, social, and emotional development.
•	Practices: Incorporate intentional teaching and critical reflection.
•	Theorists: Refer to relevant developmental theories, like Vygotsky for social interaction.
•	NQF Standards: Align with standards around development and support.
When Full Linking Is Necessary:
•	Since event samples often address specific developmental concerns, they require detailed linking across multiple EYLF outcomes and theories. Full linking to service philosophy and practices is also needed.

7. Running Records
Description:
Running records provide detailed, continuous observation of a child’s actions, interactions, and behaviours during a set period.
Purpose:
To offer a comprehensive understanding of a child’s learning style and development.
Linking Requirements (High):
•	EYLF Outcomes: Link to multiple EYLF outcomes reflecting various aspects of learning.
•	Practices: Focus on holistic approaches and play-based learning.
•	Theorists: Include connections to theorists like Piaget or Bronfenbrenner.
•	Service Philosophy: Highlight how the observation reflects the service’s learning environment.
•	NQF Standards: Include standards related to child development, learning, and exploration.
When Full Linking Is Necessary:
•	Running records require high levels of linking because they capture a broad, detailed view of the child’s development. Connecting to multiple EYLF outcomes, practices, and theorists is essential.

Others types of the observations:-
________________________________________
For the additional observation types you've listed, the necessity of linking depends on the type of documentation and the depth of reflection expected. Here's a breakdown of whether linking is required and how it should be approached:

8. Photos and Videos
Description:
Visual documentation of children's learning and play experiences, often accompanied by brief descriptions or captions.
Purpose:
To capture children’s learning in action, providing visual evidence for assessment and reflection. This also serves as a memory aid to reflect on later.
Linking Requirements (Minimal):
•	EYLF Outcome: Link to one relevant outcome, depending on what the photo or video represents.
•	Brief Interpretation: Provide context or a caption explaining what the child was doing and how it connects to their development.
When Minimal Linking Is Enough:
•	Photos and videos are typically supportive tools and do not require deep linking unless used within a more detailed learning story or running record. A simple connection to an EYLF outcome (e.g., "Outcome 4: Children are confident and involved learners") is often sufficient.
•	Theorists, practices, and standards are not usually required unless the photo/video is being used in a comprehensive reflection or learning story.

9. Sociograms
Description:
A diagrammatic observation method that maps out social relationships and interactions among children in a group.
Purpose:
To track and understand social dynamics, friendships, and patterns of interaction within the group.
Linking Requirements (Moderate):
•	EYLF Outcome: Link to social and emotional outcomes like Outcome 1 (Children have a strong sense of identity) or Outcome 2 (Children are connected with and contribute to their world).
•	Principles: Reference holistic approaches and partnerships with families and communities as it relates to social dynamics.
When Moderate Linking Is Sufficient:
•	Sociograms are useful for tracking social development, so linking to EYLF outcomes related to social interaction is important. However, they do not require extensive linking to theorists or practices unless a deeper analysis of the child’s social development is being conducted.
•	Service philosophy may be referenced if it includes a focus on social skills and peer relationships, but this is optional based on the level of reflection.

10. Work Samples and Learning Artifacts
Description:
Collecting children's artwork, writing, or constructions as evidence of their learning and development.
Purpose:
To showcase children’s progress in specific skills such as fine motor development, creativity, problem-solving, or literacy.
Linking Requirements (Moderate to High):
•	EYLF Outcomes: Link to relevant outcomes such as Outcome 4 (Children are confident and involved learners) or Outcome 5 (Children are effective communicators).
•	Practices: Connect to intentional teaching or assessment for learning, as work samples often provide insight into ongoing development.
•	Theorists (Optional): Could link to theorists like Piaget (cognitive development) if analysing problem-solving or exploration through the artifact.
When Moderate to High Linking Is Necessary:
•	Work samples may be used in portfolios or learning stories and often require a strong connection to multiple EYLF outcomes and teaching practices, especially when assessing development over time.
•	Linking to the service philosophy is helpful when the artifact reflects key goals of creativity, exploration, or problem-solving.


Simplified Intensity Breakdown:
•	Minimal Linking Required:
o	Anecdotal Records
o	Jottings
o	Checklists
o	Photos and Videos
•	Moderate Linking Required:
o	Time Samples

Conclusion for New Learners:
For new learners, understanding the intensity of linking is essential in effective documentation. Anecdotal records, jottings, and checklists are quick and require minimal linking—just focus on one EYLF outcome. In contrast, learning stories, event samples, and running records need comprehensive linking, covering multiple outcomes, theorists, and practices. Time samples sit in the middle, needing moderate connections to key outcomes and principles. This guide simplifies the process, ensuring that new learners understand when to use minimal or full linking effectively.
